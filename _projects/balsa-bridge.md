### Project Summary

This project involved designing and constructing a full 3-dimensional truss bridge was with balsa wood with the overall goal
of maximizing strength-to-weight ratio (PV), where:
\begin{equation}
PV = \frac{\text{Max applied load}}{\text{Mass of the truss}}
\end{equation}
The truss was suspended across a gap, with a hook on one side and a platform on the other. Design
constraints included dimensional constraints (40cm × 8cm × 10cm), as well as material constraints
(amount of balsa wood and hardwood dowel).
Various concepts were evaluated based on design criteria, such as load capacity, material efficiency,
and construction-related considerations. After these concepts were evaluated, the final design was
chosen and calculations were done, with a theoretical PV of 258.6.
The final design was realized with three iterations; an initial iteration to test the design and identify
weaknesses, a second iteration with minor tweaks to address these weaknesses, and a third iteration
prepared for the official competition. The official bridge evaluated at the competition had a mass of
15.9g and was able to hold 5kg (failing due to link tearing when 5.5kg was loaded), resulting in a PV
of 314.4; this result is reasonably close to our theoretical calculations and preliminary tests.
