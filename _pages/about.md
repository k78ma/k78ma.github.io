Hi! Iâ€™m Kai. Welcome to my portfolio website.

I want to make robots smarter with AI. Specific interests include:
- **Perception** (deep learning, computer vision, 3D scene representation)
- **Robot learning** (reinforcement learning, planning, control)
- **Localization & mapping** (SLAM, state estimation, kinematics)
- Other impactful applications of AI (healthcare, agriculture, mining)

Through my past work and projects, I've gained significant experience with developing intelligent systems, from self-driving cars to robotic arms. I also have skills in hardware/electrical engineering, mechanical design, and integrating these with software to create fully-functioning products.  

**Currently seeking Summer 2023 internships!**
