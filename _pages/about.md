Hi! Iâ€™m Kai. Welcome to my website.

I want to make robots smarter using AI. Specific interests include:
- Perception (deep learning, computer vision, 3D scene representation)
- Motion planning & control
- Reinforcement learning
- Simulation
- TinyML
- Other impactful applications of AI (medical imaging, mining)

Through my past work and projects, I've gained significant experience with developing intelligent systems, from self-driving cars to robotic arms. I believe in being well-rounded; as such, I also have skills in hardware and mechanical design.

**Currently seeking Summer 2023 internships!**
