Welcome to my website!

I'm a third-year student at the University of Waterloo, studying Mechatronics Engineering (+ AI option). Some things I've worked on:
- Autonomous industrial vehicles at [Polymath Robotics](https://www.polymathrobotics.com/)
- MoE perception models for robot picking with [FLAIROP](https://flairop.com/)
- Medical deep learning on the [COVID-Net](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/research-collaboration/programs/covid-net-ai-assisted-diagnosis-prognosis-covid-19-infection) project
- Building a self-driving car at [WATonomous](https://www.watonomous.ca/)

Recently, I've been interested in building software for robots, as well as research for AI/ML. You can see what I've been learning and what I've been up to by visiting my collection of 700+ [notes](https://k78ma.github.io/quartz).
