Hi! Iâ€™m Kai. Welcome to my website.

I use AI to build smarter robots and autonomous systems. Some specific interests include:
- **Perception** (ML/DL, sensor fusion, 3D scene representation)
- **Navigation & Localization** (SLAM, mapping, state estimation)
- **Planning & Controls** (Trajectory optimization, MPC)
- Other impactful applications of AI (healthcare, agriculture, mining)

Through my past work and projects, I've gained significant experience with developing intelligent systems, from self-driving vehicles to robotic arms. I also have research experience in various areas of AI with peer-reviewed publications. In general, I aim to find simple solutions to complex problems in order to make the things I build powerful and flexible.

**Seeking co-op/internship positions for Jan-Apr 2024.**
