Welcome to my website!

I'm a third-year student at the University of Waterloo, studying Mechatronics Engineering (+ AI option). Some things I've worked on:
- Multi-sensor fusion for autonomous vehicles at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/)
- Industrial robotics at [Polymath Robotics](https://www.polymathrobotics.com/)
- MoE perception models for robot picking with [FLAIROP](https://flairop.com/)
- Medical deep learning on the [COVID-Net](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/research-collaboration/programs/covid-net-ai-assisted-diagnosis-prognosis-covid-19-infection) project
- Building a self-driving car from the ground up at [WATonomous](https://www.watonomous.ca/)

I'm primarily interested in robotics, with a preference for research and research-adjacent work. My current research interests are self-supervised learning and effective world modeling. You can see what I've been learning and what I've been up to by visiting my collection of 1000+ [notes](https://k78ma.github.io/quartz).
