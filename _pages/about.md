**Seeking co-op/internship positions for Fall 2024.**

Hi! Iâ€™m Kai. Welcome to my website.

I use AI to build smarter robots and autonomous systems. Some specific interests include:
- Robotics (Perception, motion planning, SLAM, controls)
- Foundation models, scaling, and the path toward AGI
- Impactful applications of AI (healthcare, agriculture, mining)

Through my past work and projects, I've gained significant experience with developing intelligent systems, from self-driving vehicles to robotic arms. I also have research experience in various areas of AI with peer-reviewed publications. In general, I aim to find simple solutions to complex problems in order to make the things I build powerful and flexible.
